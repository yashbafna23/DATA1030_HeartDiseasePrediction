# DATA1030_HeartDiseasePrediction
DATA1030 Coursework Project - Heart Disease Prediction 


Heart diseases have become extremely common these days due to changing lifestyle. High blood pressure, diabetes, hyper tension and cholesterol are some of the major factors that lead to heart attacks. With the advancement of technology, we can now predict using some important factors how likely a person is to get a heart disease. 

The dataset we will be working on is from UCI’s Machine Learning repository. This dataset consists of thirteen features representing different parameters which will be used to predict if the person is likely to have a heart related disease or not and a target column titled ‘target’ which informs us whether the person has a heart disease or not. This is a classifcation problem and the project uses the following algorithms:

1. SVC
2. RandomForest
3. k-nearest neighbors
4. Decision Tree

Python version: 3.9
